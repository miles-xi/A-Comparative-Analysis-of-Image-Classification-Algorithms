# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Image-Classification-Algorithms

•	Designed and trained a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) alongside ResNet18 and EffcientNet-B0 on 10K+ butterfly and moth images
•	Conducted controlled experiments by adjusting the hyperparameters (batch size and learning rate) and applying image preprocessing techniques (data augmentation); created reusable Python modules to streamline the workflow
•	Visualized training loss and validation accuracy across epochs, and average runtime per epoch, revealing the effect of different model architectures and configurations on classification performance and efficiency
