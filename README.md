# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Image-Classification-Algorithms

In this project, I

•	Designed and trained two custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for benchmarking alongside ResNet18 and EffcientNet-B0 on 10K+ butterfly and moth images

•	Conducted controlled experiments by adjusting the hyperparameters (batch size and learning rate) and applying image preprocessing techniques (data augmentation); created reusable Python modules to streamline the workflow

•	Visualized training loss and validation accuracy across epochs, and average runtime per epoch, revealing the effect of different model architectures and configurations on classification performance and efficiency

Please refer to 'analyses.ipynb' for analyses and findings.
