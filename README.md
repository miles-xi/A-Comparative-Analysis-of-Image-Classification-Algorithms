# A-Comparative-Analysis-of-Image-Classification-Algorithms

In this project, I

•	Built a modular ML pipeline to preprocess 10K+ images, train CNN models, and evaluate model performance 

•	Conducted controlled experiments with various model architectures (custom networks, ResNet18, and EffcientNet-B0), tuning hyperparameters (batch size, learning rate), and applying image preprocessing techniques (data augmentation)

•	Visualized training loss and validation accuracy (with 95% confidence interval) for the final epoch, and average runtime per epoch, revealing the effect of different model architectures and configurations on classification performance and efficiency

Please refer to 'analyses.ipynb' for analyses and findings.
